# ESP32-Sprinkler
this is last release of OPENSPRINKLER ported to ESP32.
It is derived for my version of ESP8266 "OpenSprinkler"
this repo is consistent with the previous with repo ESP32-Sprinkler but has been clean-up and contain following additons:

-LoRa remote Stations that fully support SmartSolenoid remote valves.   
-minor bug fixing.    
-BLE remote stations to support SmartSolenoid (code size is too larger ..this require non standard partitions)
